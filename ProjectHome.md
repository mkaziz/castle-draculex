The concept is for an action adventure game with horror elements. Our goal is to make the player scared, not through simple “monster pops out at the player” moments with shrill music to surprise them, but rather through a steady buildup of dread in the player. Our user should be scared of continuing to play, but compelled to continue because of the exciting experience of escaping/killing monsters, uncovering more of the storyline, and ultimately achieving cathartic closure through the completion of the game.
